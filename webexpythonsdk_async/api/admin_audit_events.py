        This method supports Webex's implementation of RFC5988 Web
        Linking to provide pagination support.  It returns a generator
        container that incrementally yields all audit events returned by the
        query.  The generator will automatically request additional 'pages' of
        responses from Webex as needed until all responses have been returned.
        The container makes the generator safe for reuse.  A new API call will
        be made, using the same parameters that were specified when the
        generator was created, every time a new iterator is requested from the
        container.

        Args:
            orgId(str): List events in this organization, by ID.
            _from(str): List events which occurred after a specific
                date and time.
            to(str): List events which occurred before a specific date
                and time.
            actorId(str): List events performed by this person, by ID.
            max(int): Limit the maximum number of events in the response. The
                maximum value is 200.
            offset(int): Offset from the first result that you want to fetch.
            **request_parameters: Additional request parameters (provides
                support for parameters that may be added in the future).

        Returns:
            GeneratorContainer: A GeneratorContainer which, when iterated,
            yields the organizations returned by the Webex query.

        Raises:
